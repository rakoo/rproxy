# Signature

signature := MAGIC VERSION BLOCKSIZE block*

MAGIC := "rproxy"

VERSION := NBO uint32

BLOCKSIZE := NBO uint32

block := weak strong

weak := NBO uint32

strong := byte[20]

## Notes:

VERSION is currently set to 1. This is important, because some elements
are not specified:
  - weak checksum is adler-32
  - strong checksum is sha1, hence the 20-byte long strong sig

BLOCKSIZE is chosen so that the signature doesn't exceed 1024B too much
(we don't want to send too many because upstream bandwidth is expensive)
